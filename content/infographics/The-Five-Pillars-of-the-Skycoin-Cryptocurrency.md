The 5 Pillars of Skycoin

## __1. SKYCOIN__

a truly decentralized, 51% attack proof, lightning quick cryptocurrency that was designed to fullfill satoshi’s original vision.

## __2. SKYLEDGER__

a mesh network that allows you to earn Skycoin for forwarding traffic/bandwidth. This is a similar to Tor or BitTorrent, except that you will be paid to participate.

## __3. SKYWIRE__

a platform similar to Ethereum’s ERC20 platform, in the way a 1992 Geo Metro is similar to a 2018 Bugatti Chiron. They are both cars after all.  

## __4. DECENTRALIZED APPS__

an ecosystem of apps being built on top of the previous three things. 

## __5. SKYMINERS__
Our very own hardware platform. The Backbome which supports it all.
