Mercoledì scorso, gli sviluppatori di Bitcoin hanno sospeso i piani per introdurre il controverso aggiornamento del software Segwit2x. L'aggiornamento 2x avrebbe aumentato la dimensione di ogni blocco da 1 MB a 2 MB, raddoppiando la capacità di transazione di Bitcoin. Segwit2x era stato pianificato per diversi mesi ed è stato programmato per entrare in vigore intorno al 16 novembre.

È evidente che Bitcoin abbia un problema di scalabilità. Segwit2x aveva lo scopo di risolvere questo problema aumentando le dimensioni del blocco. Con blocchi più grandi, le transazioni potrebbero fluire più rapidamente e la valuta sarebbe in grado di gestire una crescita continua.

Tuttavia, Segwit2x ha anche comportato alcuni rischi. L'aggiornamento avrebbe introdotto un *hard fork* nella blockchain, dividendolo in due. Se un numero insufficiente di utenti avesse scento di adottare l'aggiornamento 2x, Bitcoin avrebbe potuto suddividersi in due valute concorrenti, con conseguenti potenziali perdite di fondi. Questo fattore di rischio ha spinto gli sviluppatori di Segwit2x a cancellare l'aggiornamento.

La cancellazione è stata annunciata tramite una e-mail dal CEO di BitGo, Mike Belshe. Il messaggio è stato firmato da altri cinque amministratori delegati del team di sviluppo Segwit2x: Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Peter Smith, Erik Voorhees e Jeff Garzik.

In the email, Belshe wrote:

It’s clear why the fork was called off: too much controversy, not enough consensus (at least, that’s what the developers claim). But one thing that nobody seems to be talking about is how the fork was called off, and what that choice says about Bitcoin in general. 

Bitcoin initially positioned itself as a decentralized network where users could transact freely without third party interference or manipulation from centralized powers. Yet the decision to suspend Segwit2x was made by just six developers. There was no vote. The Bitcoin community didn’t reach a consensus – instead, the decision was made for them.

The indecision surrounding Segwit2x created opportunity. After 2x’s suspension, Bitcoin’s price spiked and reached a record high. The outcome may be a sign of optimism, but it also raises questions about market influencers. Who ultimately benefits from the discord within the Bitcoin community – the users, or the central powers that control the network?

Bitcoin has not lived up to its philosophy. It’s far from decentralized. There is no consensus anymore: a handful of people control Bitcoin’s fate. The sudden Segwit2x suspension, whether it’s good or bad, is a dramatic indication of just how little power an average Bitcoin user really has.

Bitcoin’s monopolization issues stem from a basic design flaw: the mining system. Mining makes it impossible for Bitcoin to achieve its original goals. As miners receive block rewards for processing transactions, power concentrates with those who can process more. The result: a network dominated by just two or three large miners who wield a disproportionate amount of influence over the network.

Skycoin is designed specifically to address these problems. It’s a next-generation cryptocurrency that removes the mining requirement and provides a fully decentralized blockchain. Network decisions aren’t made by a few powerful people, but by the community as a whole. With peer-to-peer consensus, Skycoin protects users against the kind of manipulation we’re seeing in Bitcoin today.

Skycoin achieves consensus with a novel algorithm called Obelisk. This algorithm spreads influence across the network through a “web of trust.” The web of trust keeps the network honest by providing transparency for its users. 

Each node in Skycoin’s network subscribes to other nodes. Nodes are assigned personal blockchains that publicly broadcast their actions. The community can view and audit the nodes. If a node behaves suspiciously or maliciously, its connections can be cut, diminishing its influence. Obelisk strengthens collective decision-making and creates a network that’s built on relationships, not processing power.

As Bitcoin wobbles on shaky foundations of mining and price manipulation, Skycoin is bringing the world a different option. It delivers a peer-to-peer network that’s decentralized and user-centric. Bitcoin may be controlled by a few influential individuals, but Skycoin is owned by its community. It’s the next logical step in cryptocurrency evolution.
