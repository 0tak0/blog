Satoshi’s original vision for Bitcoin was revolutionary. A global currency that existed abovenations and out of the reach of trusts and inflation, Bitcoin should have rocked thefinancial world to its core. But the vision failed. Instead of ushering in a new era ofdecentralization, Bitcoin itself became centralized. Power concentrated into three majormining pools. Transaction speed slowed to hours. Fees skyrocketed to their current $40 level.Today, it’s clear that Bitcoin didn’t deliver on its promise of a decentralized, peer-to-peerdigital currency.
Skycoin is here to fix that. Over the past five years, the Skycoin Project’s research anddevelopment team has worked to find innovative ways to improve legacy PoW/PoS algorithms.Skycoin’s new consensus algorithm restores control of the network to the users. It goes backto Satoshi’s original vision, paving the way for a mass adoption of cryptocurrency that willreplace the legacy banking system.
The unique features of Skycoin set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. Unlike most recentcoins, Skycoin has its own blockchain, consensus algorithm, and developers. Skycoin is not anEthereum ERC20 token. It’s a third-generation cryptocurrency based on the brand-new consensusframework Obelisk. Skycoin uses Obelisk to decentralize transaction processing and approval.
Skycoin’s revolutionary consensus algorithm lets transactions happen in seconds, not hours.This eliminates the performance gap between blockchain-based payments and centralized creditcard networks. With zero transaction fees and lightning-fast speed, Skycoin represents thefirst viable alternative to centralized banking. It’s poised to do what Bitcoin couldn’t:transform the financial world for everyone across the globe.

## Digital Gold: No Inflation
Satoshi designed Bitcoin to protect wealth from inflation. Bitcoin is an immutable currency,with a finite supply capped at 21 million. By capping the number of Bitcoins that can exist,Satoshi hoped to create digital gold: he wanted to provide a premium investment that couldreturn value over the years.
Unfortunately, Bitcoin had a flaw. Miners could receive new coins through the mechanism ofblock reward. The newly-created coins caused inflation, and control centralized into one ortwo large mining pools. The effect was a monopoly that destroyed the equalizing potential ofBitcoin.
Skycoin eliminates this flaw. Like Bitcoin, Skycoin is an immutable currency with an issuancecapped at 100 million. But unlike Bitcoin, Skycoin features a redesigned consensus mechanismthat removes the block reward. This change has profound consequences for users.
Without the block reward, miners have no incentive to monopolize and control the Skycoinnetwork for personal gain. Skycoin’s design prevents the monopolization that persists inBitcoin and Ethereum. By eliminating block reward, Skycoin prevents inflation and provides amore perfect “digital gold.”
Skycoin also eliminates transaction fees. Like block rewards, transaction fees plague othercryptocurrencies by creating monetary incentives. Miners strive to push up fees at the costof the network. With no fees or block rewards, Skycoin offers an investment that can benefitall users fairly.
When Skycoin users make transactions, they spend Coin Hours, not Skycoin. Coin Hours areshares of network resources that work like dividends. A user receives one Coin Hour for eachhour they hold a Skycoin. The dividend pays out when Coin Hours are traded at exchange rates.100 million new Coin Hours are created each hour, and each transaction must burn a minimum of50% of its Coin Hour inputs. This creates scarcity and limits the number of Coin Hours incirculation to an equilibrium value. Through the Coin Hour system, Skycoin provides networktransactions that prevent inflation and support fair use.
